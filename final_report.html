<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>In this project, we aim to analyze Type II Diabetes (T2D) in the U.S.
Our group’s inherent interest in public health and chronic disease
epidemiology prompts us to explore the context of T2D in this project.
Our analysis is informed by a non-scoping literature review to
understand previous analysis performed on the distribution and
prevalence of T2D in the United States. Most relevantly, our approach
and reasoning for the variables we chose for our EDA and regression
models are inspired by <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889852921000463?via%3Dihub">Cicek
et al.(2021)</a> in their paper. In addition, all group members are
simultaneously enrolled in BIST8130: Biostatistical Methods I. As such,
we wanted to apply the statistical analysis skills and methods learned
in that class, to this project.</p>
</div>
<div id="motivation" class="section level1">
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>T2D is among the leading causes of mortality in the U.S. Through our
project, we want to consider potential the impact of covariates and
comorbidities through linear and multivariate regression models.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level1">
<h1>Related Work</h1>
<p>Type II Diabetes remains a prevalent and prioritized issue in both
public health and clinical medicine fields. The disease is characterized
by two challenges in the biochemical pathway to insulin, the body’s
hormone involved in transporting sugar to our cells. Patients with T2D
have a pancreas that both produces insufficient amounts of insulin and
whose cells react poorly to the insulin that is produced [2]. As a
result, their cells take in less amounts of sugar. These cellular
mechanisms differentiate it from Type I Diabetes, in which the patient’s
pancreas is unable to produce insulin.</p>
<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that
nearly 10% of Americans - that is, 38 million people, are currently
diagnosed with diabetes, of which close to 95% have type 2 diabetes [1].
Our initial questions and goals of this project were to analyze the
relationship between previously identified risk factors for T2D, such as
being overweight, having a family history, and physical inactivity, and
the prevalence of the disease [1].</p>
<p>In addition to the risk factors identified by the CDC, previous
research has found associations between the development of T2D and other
cardiometabolic comorbidities, including hypertension and ischemic heart
disease, in addition to depression and osteoarthritis [3]. The
temporality of these disease developments continues to remain of
interest in scientific research, as understanding the role of one
disease in the development of the other would offer valuable information
to public health, medical, and scientific experts looking for
interventions that optimize a reduction in disease development. As a
cross-sectional, ecological study, our project will unfortunately not be
able to offer insight into the causality between comorbidities and type
II diabetes, but will contribute to knowledge on observed associations
between patients with multimorbidity.</p>
</div>
<div id="guiding-questions" class="section level1">
<h1>Guiding Questions</h1>
<p>Through our analysis, we aim to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How prevalent is diabetes in the United States, as well as the
prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in particular?</li>
<li>Which lifestyle factors and comorbidities have the strongest
relationship with T2D? Is it justified to make generalizations about the
age of onset for Type 2 Diabetes?</li>
<li>By analyzing our data source, can we draw conclusions about how
comprehensive common T2D questionnaires are?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<div id="source" class="section level3">
<h3>Source</h3>
<p>Our data comes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) [<a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2023.html"
class="uri">https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2023.html</a>]
developed and aggregated by the US Centers for Disease and Prevention
(CDC). The data captures diabetes data as related to demographics,
individual behaviors, chronic health conditions, health-care access, and
use of preventive services. This longitudinal survey has been collecting
data since 1984, and was recently updated in September 2024. The data
was only available in an ‘xpt’ format. Hence, to make the data
accessible for import and analysis in R, the haven package was used to
read the xpt file and then write into an accessible csv format.</p>
<p>The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) was a
nationwide survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) to gather data on health-related risk behaviors,
chronic health conditions, and preventive health practices among adults
in the United States. The primary purpose of the BRFSS was to inform
public health policy, monitor health trends, and support the development
of health interventions. It was one of the largest continuously
conducted telephone health surveys in the world, providing critical
insights into the health status and needs of U.S. residents. The BRFSS
used Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) systems to collect
data, with respondents selected through a probability sampling method to
ensure results are representative of the U.S. adult population. In 2023,
54 states and territories participated, though data from Pennsylvania
and Kentucky were excluded due to insufficient collection. Data
collection occurred year-round, spanning all 12 months, and interviews
were conducted seven days a week, both during the day and in the
evening, to maximize response rates. Interviews lasted an average of 17
minutes for the core questionnaire, with additional time required for
optional modules and state-specific questions. The survey incorporated
both landline and cellular samples, adjusting for demographic factors
such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and marital status
through a process known as iterative proportional fitting or raking.
This methodology ensured that the BRFSS data was nationally
representative and reflective of the diverse U.S. population, making it
a valuable tool for understanding and addressing public health
challenges.</p>
</div>
<div id="import" class="section level3">
<h3>Import</h3>
<p>To clean the data, we first had to import the large XPT file and
select only the variables we were interested in analyzing related to
diabetes. We selected variables after conducting a thorough literature
review to identify which factors and comorbidities were the most
relevant to a diabetes (and specifically T2D) diagnosis.</p>
</div>
<div id="cleaning" class="section level3">
<h3>Cleaning</h3>
<p>For the coding process of cleaning the data, we recoded variables
with responses such as “refusal”, “don’t know/not sure”, and missing as
NA. Binary variables were converted from (0,1) to (No, Yes). Other
variables, including binary variables, were also re-coded as factor
variables. We identified three main variables for analysis related to
diabetes: <code>has_diabetes</code>, <code>diab_type</code>, and
<code>eval_type</code>.</p>
<p><strong><code>has_diabetes</code></strong>: This variable describes
the people in the survey who responded after being asked the question,
“Have you ever been told you had diabetes?” Overall, 432,339 people
responded to this question.</p>
<p><strong><code>diab_type</code></strong>: This variable comes directly
from the dataset, where respondents who were diabetic per the
<code>has_diabetes</code> question were asked “What type of diabetes do
you have?” Only 22,027 participants answered this question out of the
59,786 people who responded that they had diabetes. Since there are over
60% of respondents unaccounted for, this measure may not tell us enough
about risk factors or comorbidities of T2D in the general
population.</p>
<p><strong><code>eval_type</code></strong>: Due to the missing data for
<code>diab_type</code>, we created another variable
<code>eval_type</code> that describes the person’s diabetes type by
using other demographic information from this dataset. We used <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2019/19_0109.htm">this paper</a>
published by the CDC that used the same BRFSS survey from 2014 to
classify T2D diagnosis. In this paper, they classified a survey
respondent to have type II diabetes if the respondent was older than 30,
not pregnant, and answered yes to the question “Have you ever been told
you have diabetes?”</p>
<p>We then classified a respondent to have type II diabetes if the
respondent was older than 30, not pregnant, and were diabetic as per the
<code>has_diabetes</code> question. We classified a respondent to have
type I diabetes if the respondent was younger than 30 and were diabetic
as per the <code>has_diabetes</code> question.</p>
<p>The final cleaned dataset <code>cleaned_diabetes_data.csv</code>
contains 40 columns and 433,323 rows. To access this data, users can
find it in our GitHub repo at
<code>data/cleaned_diabetes_data.csv</code>. A metadata table with a
description and coding of each variable in the cleaned dataset can be
found in Appendix A.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-data-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
<div id="overall-distribution" class="section level3">
<h3>Overall distribution</h3>
<p>We started by examining the overall distributions of each of our
outcome variables.</p>
<p><img src="data_dist_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" /></p>
<p>Of the 433,323 respondents, 59,786 are actually diabetic.</p>
<p><img src="data_dist_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="data_dist_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" /></p>
<p>Of the people that said they had diabetes, we have just over ~20K
responses regarding the type of diabetes they have, and over ~410K
missing responses. Because of this missing data, we more heavily relied
on the evaluated type. However, it is worth noting that we are actively
excluding people diagnosed with type I diabetes after the age of 30 (as
shown below).</p>
<p><img src="data_dist_files/figure-html/onset_eval-1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="data_dist_files/figure-html/report_diab-1.png" /></p>
<p>In the graphs above, we could conclude that the overall distribution
is relatively normal related to the age of onset of diabetes diagnosis.
However, if we just consider real-time age and diabetes, we see a
different distribution. In the graph below, we see that as age
increases, the count of diabetes cases increase (using the has_diabetes
variable), with the highest number of cases being in the 65-74 age
group. The number of diabetes cases decrease slightly after age 74.</p>
<p><img src="data_dist_files/figure-html/age_diab-1.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="demographics" class="section level3">
<h3>Demographics</h3>
<p>We also explored other demographic information in relation to
diabetes diagnosis. We compared each factor to one of our three outcome
variables, has_diabetes, diab_type, and eval_type, to identify the
overarching relationship between specific demographics and diabetes,
along with similarities and differences between the various kinds of
diagnosis.</p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" /></p>
<p>People with better health and physical activity practices have fewer
diabetes diagnoses. Between type I and type II diagnoses, physical
activity is about the same, based on the reported type. On the other
hand, type II diagnoses have a higher percentage of inactive people,
based on the evaluated type.</p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" /></p>
<p>People with (at least) a college degree make up a larger proportion
of the sample of people who are not diabetic than the sample of people
who are diabetic. Surprisingly, according to the evaluated type
variable, a significantly larger percentage of people who graduated high
school have type I diabetes, compared to the percentage of people who
graduated high school with type II diabetes.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-factors" class="section level3">
<h3>Related Factors</h3>
<p>We also explored related factors to diabetes diagnosis, one of which
being blood pressure.</p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-61-1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-62-1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-63-1.png" /></p>
<p>People with low/normal blood pressure were represented much more in
the group of people who are diabetic compared to any other group. There
is a slight increase in high blood representation percentage in the type
I group compared to the type II group in the reported cases, but that is
heightened in comparing the evaluated type variable.</p>
<p>We originally explored high blood sugar and A1C checks in this
section, but decided not to publish those models because only people
with diabetes (as per has_diabetes) were asked this question, severely
skewing our results.</p>
</div>
<div id="comorbidities" class="section level3">
<h3>Comorbidities</h3>
<p>Finally, we explored comorbidities known to be shared with diabetes
diagnosis.</p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" /></p>
<p>A larger proportion of people with diabetes also have kidney disease
than other groups. The reported type shows no significant difference in
diagnosis across type of diabetes, but the evaluated type shows that
people with kidney disease are more highly represented in the group with
type II diabetes.</p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="final_eda_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" /></p>
<p>Blindness is slightly more common in people who have diabetes
compared to people who are not diabetic, but we see some opposition
between reported and evaluated type I and II diabetes status.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="additional-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>Additional Analysis</h1>
<p>Due to the formatting and order of the questions in the
questionnaire, some variables were only asked of certain people, leading
to a large amount of missing values. Since so much of our data was
missing, we decided to run some tests for the significance of the
missing data. First we ranked the variables of interest by rate of
missingness. We decided to keep those that had at least 80% of the data
present. Next, we used the chi square test for missingness to compare
variables with differing rates of missingness and see if they could be
interacting or if their missingness could be related (not at random).
After these tests, we found possible interactions between COVID-19 and
bronchitis, both of which are independently known to increase diabetes
risk. We ran one more chi square test to make sure this interaction was
statistically significant.</p>
<p>At this point we created two Generalized Linear Models (GLM) using
sex, age, obesity, race, good health, kidney disease, stroke,
bronchitis, and COVID-19 as main effects, with COVID-19 and bronchitis
as an interaction. We chose this model to try to prevent overfitting and
handle distributions that are not Gaussian, such as that of variables
like age, which is skewed due to Type 2 Diabetes being more common in
older adults.</p>
<p>The first GLM models the risk of any type of diabetes, and the second
one models the risk of Type 2 Diabetes in particular. We encountered a
significant limitation for the second model because almost 100 times as
many people reported Type 2 Diabetes as opposed to Type 1, so our model
as proposed converged and was not significant in analyzing comparative
risk.</p>
<p>Some other limitations for regression include linearity,
independence, multicollinearity, and homoscedasticity. Predictors and
outcomes may have a non-linear relationship, and our model may not
properly account for those. Additionally, outliers and observations
being dependent on each other can cause misleading results.
Multicollinearity, or predictors being correlated with one another, can
also inflate standard error and coefficient estimates. Additionally, if
the variance of residuals is not constant, or not homoscedastic, our
results could be biased.</p>
<p>Overall, the limitations of any regression model will always be that
regression does not establish causation. Despite our efforts to test
significant relationships, changes in a predictor cannot be correlated
with changes in the outcome based purely on this model. However,
regression models remain an essential tool to help us predict risk and
inform further research.</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>How prevalent is diabetes in the United States, as well as the
prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in particular?</h3>
<p>Overall, the prevalence of diabetes in 2023 across the U.S. and its
territories was 13.8%, assuming our dataset was representative of this
population. The lowest prevalence of diabetes was in Colorado (9.3%) and
the highest prevalence was in West Virginia. Of the people with
diabetes, reportedly over 90% have type II diabetes (based on the
results of the <code>diab_type</code> outcome). Using our evaluation of
diabetes type (eval_type), 98% of people in the US have type II
diabetes.</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>Which lifestyle factors and comorbidities have the strongest
relationship with T2D? Is it justified to make generalizations about the
age of onset for Type 2 Diabetes?</h3>
<p>As investigated in our exploratory data analysis, we identified
multiple comorbidities and lifestyle factors that have a high
correlation with a diabetes diagnosis, and some also with a specifically
significant relationship with type II diabetes. People with less than
good health and generally inactive physical lifestyles are more
represented in the diabetic group. Less than good health tend to be
similar across types, but lower physical activity is more heavily
represented in the type II group. Overall, we can note that the type I
and type II split are fairly similar for all lifestyle factors, but
generally, since the split is higher in our evaluated type variable (98%
type II vs. 2% type I), there is higher representation of every
comorbidity or lifestyle in the type II group.</p>
<p>Two factors that did not follow this pattern were depression and
blindness. In both of these cases, respondents who answered yes were
represented more in the type I group than the type II group. It is worth
noting that the results were very similar across all groups for
has_diabetes, as well as both types for diab_type. Therefore, these
results may have been skewed by other factors, such as age, pregnancy
status, and gender, all of which were also determinants for the
evaluated type variable.</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>By analyzing our data source, can we draw conclusions about how
comprehensive common T2D questionnaires are?</h3>
<p>The best way that we were able to analyze the data source was by
comparing these different outcome variables. Overall, has_diabetes
performed well in our models and led to generally fair models. However,
as seen in our EDA, there were some differences in performance for
evaluated and reported type.</p>
<p>Overall, the reported and evaluated type variables perform similarly
in identifying any significant differences in type across different
lifestyle factors and comorbidities. However, the eval_type results in
higher skews in either diagnosis compared to the reported type. Suppose
a factor is associated with type II more than it is associated with type
I in the reported type. In that case, it is heavily skewed towards type
II in the evaluated type comparison. If a factor is generally associated
with both, it is more heavily skewed towards type I. This can be
dangerous in performing significance test and may be one reason for why
our models are generally inconclusive.</p>

<div id="regression" class="section level1">
<h1>Regression</h1>
<p>One of our goals for this project was to explore associations between
diabetes prevalence, type of diabetes, and various lifestyle factors
through regression. When deciding which variables to use as predictive
factors in our generalized linear models, we looked to existing
literature about lifestyle factors associated with diabetes and also
considered how much of the data for that variable was present or missing
in our dataset. On the <a href="regression_final.html">Regression</a>
page of our website, we have briefly defined the variables we used as
predictors in our models and have also provided peer-reviewed sources as
evidence to support our decisions.</p>
<p>We used generalized linear models to predict two outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>has_diabetes</code>: Does a study participant have any form of
diabetes?</li>
<li><code>diab_type</code>: If a study participant does have diabetes,
then which type?</li>
</ul>
<p>Through this process, we found that several lifestyle and demographic
variables were strongly associated with these outcomes. These included
age, race, sex, obesity, overall health, and certain comorbidities (ie.
covid, bronchitis, stroke).</p>
<p>In order to assess our models, we performed 100-fold cross-validation
and extracted RMSE for each model. From the results of our cross
validation and error assessment, we saw that our second model, which
predicts <code>diab_type</code> appeared to perform relatively well,
especially considering the volume of missing data we were dealing with.
This model had a mean RMSE of less than 30% across the 100-fold
validation we performed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we saw that there were likely some issues with the
first model, which predicts <code>has_diabetes</code>. The mean RMSE
appears to be very low, close to 0, which is highly unrealistic. It
hints at deeper issues within the model, perhaps stemming from the
unusually low p-values of significance shown by several of the predictor
variables of that model. Unfortunately, due to limited timeframe and
project scope, we were not able to pursue this issue further. In future
exploration, we would dedicate more time to investigating, correcting,
and refining our models.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level1">
<h1>Limitations</h1>
<p>As with any analysis of external data, our project too, faced
limitations because of restrictions in our data source.</p>
<p>Despite being conducted by the U.S. CDC, the data was not as
comprehensive as we had hoped and we were limited by the narrow focus of
some survey questions and a lack of strict follow-up among participants.
No questions related to family history or environmental exposures were
asked, which would be relevant to better being able to diagnose
respondents with type I diabetes.</p>
<p>Taking a closer look at our data, we are missing ~40,000 rows related
to the specific type of diabetes diagnosis (difference between
has_diabetes == Diabetes and diab_type != NA). Because of this, we felt
the need to create a new variable that could better represent our
population. We were not sure imputation would be the best way to handle
this because of the large amount of missing data, so we decided to
depend on another data source to create a justifiable evaluated
variable. However, the constraints of the variable that were defined in
our literature review caused us to exclude any respondents above the age
of 30 who were diagnosed with type I diabetes as per the reported type
variable. Therefore, the distribution of the evaluated type is skewed
heavily towards type II diagnosis for certain age groups and
demographics. Moving forward, the constraints on the onset can be a
major limitation for all of our analysis.</p>
<p>In addition, the metrics of some questions were unclear and it was
unknown how many participants and/or what subgroup of participants were
asked a question. For example, inquiries regarding high blood sugar and
A1C were only asked to people that did not have diabetes. Only people
that were reported diabetic were asked if they had received an A1C-level
check within the last 12 months. In addition, for the small subset of
participants who were questioned, they were not mandated to report their
specific A1C result.</p>
