<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, we analyze Type II Diabetes (T2D) in the U.S through
the development of a customizable dashboard that users can use to gain
valuable information about their individual risk factors for T2D
development based on the metrics they enter. input specific criteria and
our software would yield relevant data. Our group’s inherent interest in
public health and chronic disease epidemiology prompts us to explore the
context of T2D in this project. Our analysis is informed by a
non-scoping literature review to understand previous analysis performed
on the distribution and prevalence of T2D in the United States. Most
relevantly, our approach and reasoning for the variables we chose for
our EDA and regression models are inspired by <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889852921000463?via%3Dihub">Cicek
et al.</a> (2021) in their paper. In addition, all group members are
simultaneously enrolled in BIST8130: Biostatistical Methods I. As such,
we wanted to apply the statistical analysis skills and methods learned
in that class, to this project.</p>
</div>
<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>T2D is among the leading causes of mortality in the U.S. Through our
project, we conduct an in-depth analysis of risk factors and lifestyle
choices that contribute to its development. We consider potential the
impact of co-variates and co-morbitities through linear and multivariate
regression models. The deliverable includes graphical representations of
regression models, maps of T2D across the US, and a customizable
dashboard outlining potential risk factors for T2D. We hope to create a
dashboard that provides a predictive estimate to help users understand
how they can mitigate their risk and prevent developing T2D in the
future.</p>

<h3>Source</h3>
<p>Our data comes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) [<a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2023.html"
class="uri">https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2023.html</a>]
developed and aggregated by the US Centers for Disease and Prevention
(CDC). The data captures diabetes data as related to demographics,
individual behaviors, chronic health conditions, health-care access, and
use of preventive services. This longitudinal survey has been collecting
data since 1984, and was recently updated in September 2024. The data
was only available in an ‘xpt’ format. Hence, to make the data
accessible for import and analysis in R, the haven package was used to
read the xpt file and then write into an accessible csv format.</p>
<p>The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) was a
nationwide survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) to gather data on health-related risk behaviors,
chronic health conditions, and preventive health practices among adults
in the United States. The primary purpose of the BRFSS was to inform
public health policy, monitor health trends, and support the development
of health interventions. It was one of the largest continuously
conducted telephone health surveys in the world, providing critical
insights into the health status and needs of U.S. residents. The BRFSS
used Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) systems to collect
data, with respondents selected through a probability sampling method to
ensure results are representative of the U.S. adult population. In 2023,
54 states and territories participated, though data from Pennsylvania
and Kentucky were excluded due to insufficient collection. Data
collection occurred year-round, spanning all 12 months, and interviews
were conducted seven days a week, both during the day and in the
evening, to maximize response rates. Interviews lasted an average of 17
minutes for the core questionnaire, with additional time required for
optional modules and state-specific questions. The survey incorporated
both landline and cellular samples, adjusting for demographic factors
such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and marital status
through a process known as iterative proportional fitting or raking.
This methodology ensured that the BRFSS data was nationally
representative and reflective of the diverse U.S. population, making it
a valuable tool for understanding and addressing public health
challenges.</p>

<div id="import" class="section level3">
<h3>Import</h3>
<p>To clean the data, we first had to import the large XPT file and
select only the variables we were interested in analyzing related to
diabetes. We selected variables after conducting a thorough literature
review to identify which factors and comorbidities were the most
relevant to a diabetes (and specifically T2D) diagnosis.</p>
</div>
<div id="cleaning" class="section level3">
<h3>Cleaning</h3>
<p>For the coding process of cleaning the data, we recoded variables
with responses such as “refusal”, “don’t know/not sure”, and missing as
NA. Binary variables were converted from (0,1) to (No, Yes). Other
variables, including binary variables, were also re-coded as factor
variables. We identified three main variables for analysis related to
diabetes: <code>has_diabetes</code>, <code>diab_type</code>, and
<code>eval_type</code>.</p>
<p><strong><code>has_diabetes</code></strong>: This variable describes
the people in the survey who responded after being asked the question,
“Have you ever been told you had diabetes?” Overall, 432,339 people
responded to this question.</p>
<p><strong><code>diab_type</code></strong>: This variable comes directly
from the dataset, where respondents who were diabetic per the
<code>has_diabetes</code> question were asked “What type of diabetes do
you have?” Only 22,027 participants answered this question out of the
59,786 people who responded that they had diabetes. Since there are over
60% of respondents unaccounted for, this measure may not tell us enough
about risk factors or comorbidities of T2D in the general
population.</p>
<p><strong><code>eval_type</code></strong>: Due to the missing data for
<code>diab_type</code>, we created another variable
<code>eval_type</code> that describes the person’s diabetes type by
using other demographic information from this dataset. We used <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2019/19_0109.htm">this paper</a>
published by the CDC that used the same BRFSS survey from 2014 to
classify T2D diagnosis. In this paper, they classified a survey
respondent to have type II diabetes if the respondent was older than 30,
not pregnant, and answered yes to the question “Have you ever been told
you have diabetes?”</p>
<p>We then classified a respondent to have type II diabetes if the
respondent was older than 30, not pregnant, and were diabetic as per the
<code>has_diabetes</code> question. We classified a respondent to have
type I diabetes if the respondent was younger than 30 and were diabetic
as per the <code>has_diabetes</code> question.</p>
<p>The final cleaned dataset <code>cleaned_diabetes_data.csv</code>
contains 40 columns and 433,323 rows. To access this data, users can
find it in our GitHub repo at
<code>data/cleaned_diabetes_data.csv</code>. A metadata table with a
description and coding of each variable in the cleaned dataset can be
found in Appendix A.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>As with any analysis, our project too, faced limitations because of
restrictions in our data source. Despite being conducted by the U.S.
CDC, the data was not as comprehensive as we had hoped and were limited
by the narrow focus of some survey questions and a lack of strict
follow-up among participants. In addition, the metrics of some questions
were unclear and it was unknown how many participants and/or what
subgroup of participants were asked a question. For example, only people
that were reported diabetic were asked if they had received an A1c-level
check within the last 12 months. In addition, for the small subset of
participants who were questioned, they were not mandated to report their
specific A1c result. Further, inquiries regarding high blood sugar were
only asked to people that did not have diabetes.</p>
