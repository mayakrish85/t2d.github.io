Initial Questions: Through our analysis, we aim to discover how prevalent diabetes is in the United 
states as well as the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in particular. Furthermore, we aim to identify what lifestyle factors and comorbidities have the strongest relationship with T2D, and decide if it is justified to make generalizations about the age of onset for Type 2 Diabetes. Finally, by analyzing our data source, we aim to draw conclusions about how comprehensive common T2D questionnaires are.

Overview: In this project, we analyze Type II Diabetes (T2D) in the U.S through the development of a customizable dashboard that users can use to gain valuable information about their individual risk factors for T2D development based on the metrics they enter.  input specific criteria and our software would yield relevant data. Our groupâ€™s inherent interest in public health and chronic disease epidemiology prompts us to explore the context of T2D in this project. Our analysis is informed by a non-scoping literature review to understand previous analysis performed on the distribution and prevalence of T2D in the United States. Most relevantly, our approach and reasoning for the variables we chose for our EDA and regression models are inspired by Meryem Cicek et al. (2021) in their paper [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8383848/#:~:text=Patients%20with%20type%202%20diabetes%20mellitus%20(T2DM)%20are%20at%20high,with%20multiple%20co%2Doccurring%20conditions.&text=Clustering%20studies%20show%20common%20comorbidities,%2C%20microvascular%20conditions%2C%20and%20depression.] In addition, all group members are simultaneously enrolled in BIST8130: Biostatistical Methods I. As such, we wanted to apply the statistical analysis skills and methods learned in that class, to this project. 

Motivation: T2D is among the leading causes of mortality in the U.S. Through our project, we conduct an in-depth analysis of risk factors and lifestyle choices that contribute to its development. We consider potential the impact of co-variates and co-morbitities through linear and multivariate regression models. The deliverable includes graphical representations of regression models, maps of T2D across the US, and a customizable dashboard outlining potential risk factors for T2D. We hope to create a dashboard that provides a predictive estimate to help users understand how they can mitigate their risk and prevent developing T2D in the future. 

Data Source: Our data comes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) [https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2023.html] developed and aggregated by the US Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC). The data captures diabetes data as related to demographics, individual behaviors, chronic health conditions, health-care access, and use of preventive services. This longitudinal survey has been collecting data since 1984, and was recently updated in September 2024. The data was only available in an 'xpt' format. Hence, to make the data accessible for import and analysis in R, the haven package was used to read the xpt file and then write into an accessible csv format. 

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) was a nationwide survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to gather data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and preventive health practices among adults in the United States. The primary purpose of the BRFSS was to inform public health policy, monitor health trends, and support the development of health interventions. It was one of the largest continuously conducted telephone health surveys in the world, providing critical insights into the health status and needs of U.S. residents. The BRFSS used Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) systems to collect data, with respondents selected through a probability sampling method to ensure results are representative of the U.S. adult population. In 2023, 54 states and territories participated, though data from Pennsylvania and Kentucky were excluded due to insufficient collection. Data collection occurred year-round, spanning all 12 months, and interviews were conducted seven days a week, both during the day and in the evening, to maximize response rates. Interviews lasted an average of 17 minutes for the core questionnaire, with additional time required for optional modules and state-specific questions. The survey incorporated both landline and cellular samples, adjusting for demographic factors such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and marital status through a process known as iterative proportional fitting or raking. This methodology ensured that the BRFSS data was nationally representative and reflective of the diverse U.S. population, making it a valuable tool for understanding and addressing public health challenges.


Limitations: As with any analysis, our project too, faced limitations because of restrictions in our data source. Despite being conducted by the U.S. CDC, the data was not as comprehensive as we had hoped and were limited by the narrow focus of some survey questions and a lack of strict follow-up among participants. In addition, the metrics of some questions were unclear and it was unknown how many participants and/or what subgroup of participants were asked a question. For example, only people that were reported diabetic were asked if they had received an A1c-level check within the last 12 months. In addition, for the small subset of participants who were questioned, they were not mandated to report their specific A1c result. Further, inquiries regarding high blood sugar were only asked to people that did not have diabetes.
