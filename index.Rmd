  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <div>
    <p> Type 2 Diabetes is among the leading causes of mortality in the U.S. Through our project, we hope to uncover what lifestyles and demographics have the most significant relationship with type II diabetes, based on the findings from the annual CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. Our analysis is informed by a non-scoping literature review to understand previous analysis performed on the distribution and prevalence of T2D in the United States. 
    </p>
    <p> 
    Our deliverable includes identifying the most to least stringent levels of diagnosis for Type II diabetes, graphical and tabular representations of the distrbution of diabetes, graphical representations of regression models, and maps of T2D across the US.

  <h2>Data Sources</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
    The <a href="[https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2023.html." target="_blank">Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (2023)</a>, developed by the CDC, is a nationwide survey that collects data on health behaviors, chronic conditions, and preventive health practices among U.S. adults. Established in 1984, it provides valuable insights into public health trends and supports policy development. The dataset, recently updated in 2024, was converted from its original format to a more accessible format for analysis, enabling its use in public health research and decision-making.
