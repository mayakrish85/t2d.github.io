  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <div>
    <p> Our goal is to develop a customizable dashboard that provides users in the United States with personalized information about their risk factors for Type II Diabetes (T2D). Our analysis is informed by a non-scoping literature review to understand previous analysis performed on the distribution and prevalence of T2D in the United States. 
    
    This project was informed by research detailed in <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8383848/#:~:text=Patients%20with%20type%202%20diabetes%20mellitus%20(T2DM)%20are%20at%20high,with%20multiple%20co%2Doccurring%20conditions.&text=Clustering%20studies%20show%20common%20comorbidities,%2C%20microvascular%20conditions%2C%20and%20depression." target="_blank">Cicek et al. (2021)</a>, utilizes clustering insights to elucidate common comorbidities that we intend to analyze.

  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <div>
    Type 2 Diabetes is among the leading causes of mortality in the U.S. Through our project, we conduct an in-depth analysis of risk factors and lifestyle choices that contribute to its development. We consider potential the impact of co-variates and co-morbitities through linear and multivariate regression models. The deliverable includes graphical representations of regression models, maps of T2D across the US, and a customizable dashboard outlining potential risk factors for T2D. We hope to create a dashboard that provides a predictive estimate to help users understand how they can mitigate their risk and prevent developing T2D in the future.

  <h2>Data Sources</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
    The <a href="[https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2023.html." target="_blank">Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (2021)</a>, developed by the CDC, is a nationwide survey that collects data on health behaviors, chronic conditions, and preventive health practices among U.S. adults. Established in 1984, it provides valuable insights into public health trends and supports policy development. The dataset, recently updated in 2024, was converted from its original format to a more accessible format for analysis, enabling its use in public health research and decision-making.
